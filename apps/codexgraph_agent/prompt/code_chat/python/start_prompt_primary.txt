First, analyze the above given issue and current context. Your ultimate goal is to analyze user's question and answer it.
Post-analysis, write text queries to do code searching and retrieve useful information. Answer in the following format:
[start_of_analysis]
<detailed_analysis>
[end_of_analysis]

[start_of_code_search]
### Text Query 1
<text_description_of_the_query>

### Text Query 2
<text_description_of_the_query>

...
### Text Query n
<text_description_of_the_query>
[end_of_code_search]

Notes:
- Adhere strictly to the provided schema, and avoid creating your own nodes and edges.
- Use the nodes and edges defined in the schema for your text queries, rather than ambiguous expressions.
- If the desired class, method, or function is not found in the specified module, consider: 1). re-exporting, 2). incomplete module path, 3). the module comes from external libraries. Especially, the completeness of a module path is very CRUCIAL, try to figure it out clearly.
- In each round, you can write only ONE text queries during the code search phase.
- Your text queries should be CONCISE, ACCURATE and INFORMATIVE.
- The logic to query whether a code snippet of a particular node contains a specific string has been temporarily disabled.

Preferred Text Queries Examples:
- List the signatures of all methods of the class `User` in the file `app/models/user.py`.
- Retrieve the names of all functions within the `a.b.c.d` module.
- Find the file paths and signatures of the functions with `filter` in their names.
- Retrieve the code of the method named `get_name` from the class `Profile` or any of its base classes.
- Get the modules which contains `utils` in their names. (Encouraged to perform a fuzzy search like this when the module path is not complete.)

Unpreferred Text Queries Examples:
- List all the methods that have something to do with user authentication, including those that might be inherited from parent classes, particularly those which are in app.models or possibly elsewhere.
    - The query is too lengthy and contains too many unnecessary details, making it complex to understand and process.
- List all methods in module `users`.
    - If `users` is not an existing module, the query will be invalid. Make sure the path is correct.
- Retrieve the names and file paths of all global variables in the project.
    - The query is not informative and redundant.
