First, analyze the above given issue and current context. Clarify the user's issue report by identifying which project it pertains to, what problem or error occurred, and what clues are available to locate the problematic area, among other aspects. \
Post-analysis, write text queries to do code searching and retrieve useful information. Answer in the following format:
[start_of_analysis]
<detailed_analysis>
[end_of_analysis]

[start_of_code_search]
### Text Query 1
<text_description_of_the_query>

### Text Query 2
<text_description_of_the_query>

...
### Text Query n
<text_description_of_the_query>
[end_of_code_search]

Notes:
- Adhere strictly to the provided schema, and avoid creating your own nodes and edges.
- Use the nodes and edges defined in the schema for your text queries, rather than ambiguous expressions.
- The buggy code exists solely in the project described in the issue (e.g., django, sklearn). Buggy location is usually not in the tests files or external packages.
- If the desired class, method, or function is not found in the specified module, consider: 1). re-exporting, 2). incomplete module path, 3). the module comes from external libraries. Especially, the completeness of a module path is very CRUCIAL, try to figure it out clearly.
- In each round, you can write only ONE text queries during the code search phase.
- Your text queries should be CONCISE, ACCURATE and INFORMATIVE.
- Users often attach the code with errors they encounter or minimal reproducible examples in the issues. These code scripts provide clues about the bug, but the code itself will not be stored in the code graph database. The code graph database only records the source code of the project.
- The logic to query whether a code snippet of a particular node contains a specific string has been temporarily disabled.

Preferred Text Queries Examples:
- List the signatures of all methods of the class `User` in the file `app/models/user.py`.
- Retrieve the names of all functions within the `a.b.c.d` module.
- Find the file paths and signatures of the functions with `filter` in their names.
- Retrieve the code of the method named `get_name` from the class `Profile` or any of its base classes.
- Get the modules which contains `utils` in their names. (Encouraged to perform a fuzzy search like this when the module path is not complete.)

Unpreferred Text Queries Examples:
- List all the methods that have something to do with user authentication, including those that might be inherited from parent classes, particularly those which are in app.models or possibly elsewhere.
    - The query is too lengthy and contains too many unnecessary details, making it complex to understand and process.
- List all methods in module `users`.
    - If `users` is not an existing module, the query will be invalid. Make sure the path is correct.
- Retrieve the names and file paths of all global variables in the project.
    - The query is not informative and redundant.

Preferred Text Descriptions for Bug Locations Examples:
- The bug is located in the class User in the module `app.models`.
- The issue is within the function process_data in the module `app.processors`.
- The problem occurs in the method authenticate of the class `LoginManager` in the module `app.auth`.
