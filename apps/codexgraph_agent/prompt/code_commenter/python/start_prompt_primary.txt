### Code to be Annotated:
<code>
```python
${file_path}
${user_query}
```
</code>

### Task Instructions:
Your ultimate goal is to add meaningful and standardized comments to the function within the content enclosed by <code> and </code>. To achieve this, you must analyze the given code first. Post-analysis, you have two action options:
1. `ADD_COMMENTS`, Use this action to add comments directly to the function in one step.
2. `TEXT_QUERIES`, Use this action to write text queries to retrieve relevant information from the graph database.

#### Detailed Comments Notes:
The comments should include:
1. Function Description: A brief description of the function's purpose and functionality.
2. Parameters: A list of the function's parameters, including their descriptions (omit types if they are unknown). If there are no parameters, state "Parameters: None".
3. Returns: A description of the function's return value, including its type (optional) and meaning (omit types if they are unknown). If there is no return value, state "Returns: None".
4. Exceptions (optional): A list of exceptions the function might raise, including the conditions under which they are raised.

Example of detailed comments:
```python
def example_function(param1: int, param2):
    """
    This function performs a specific operation on two parameters and returns the result.

    Parameters:
    param1 (int): The first parameter, which is an integer.
    param2: The second parameter.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the operation is successful, False otherwise.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If param1 is negative.
    TypeError: If param2 is not a string.
    """
```

#### Final Output Format:
You will format your final output as follows:
```json
{{"thought": "$$THOUGHT", "action": "$$ACTION_NAME", "action_input": "$$INPUT"}}
```
Specifically,
1. for the ADD_COMMENTS action, replace $$INPUT with useful hints derived from your retrieved content and analysis.
2. for the TEXT_QUERIES action, $$INPUT is the text query statement, formatted as:
[start_of_text_queries]
### Text Query 1
<text_description_of_the_query>

### Text Query 2
<text_description_of_the_query>
...
### Text Query n
<text_description_of_the_query>
[end_of_text_queries]
3. In the thought section, replace $$THOUGHT with a detailed analysis of the current context.

#### Notes:
1. Ensure the comments are meaningful, clear, and follow standard commenting practices.
2. Analyze the code thoroughly before adding comments to ensure accuracy and relevance.
3. When taking TEXT_QUERIES action:
    - Adhere strictly to the provided schema, and avoid creating your own nodes and edges.
    - Use the nodes and edges defined in the schema for your text queries, rather than ambiguous expressions.
    - Ensure your text queries are fact-based, descriptive, and clear; avoid inferential or assumption-based queries.
    - If you cannot find the desired information from a class, consider examining its base classes.
    - If the desired class, method, or function is not found in the specified module, it might be due to re-exporting or because the module comes from external libraries.
    - Pay attention to the imports in the provided code file; they offer module path hints for the target objects.
4. Preferred Text Queries Examples:
    - Retrieve all methods and fields of the class "XYZ" in the "a.b.c" module.
    - Retrieve all functions within the "a.b.c.d" module.
    - Retrieve functions whose names contain "get" within the "a.b.c.d" module.
    - Retrieve the method named "get_name" from the class "ABC" or any of its base classes.
5. You can only perform one action per round.
6. It is not recommended to take ADD_COMMENTS actions if you have not gathered specific code information.
