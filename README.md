## Quickstart

### Agent Chat
This project supports interaction with models via the MCP (Model Context Protocol). Below is a complete example showing
how to configure and run an LLMAgent with MCP support.

✅ Chat with agents using the MCP protocol: [MCP Playground](https://modelscope.cn/mcp/playground)

By default, the agent uses ModelScope's API inference service. Before running the agent, make sure to set your
ModelScope API key.
```bash
export MODELSCOPE_API_KEY={your_modelscope_api_key}
```
You can find or generate your API key at https://modelscope.cn/my/myaccesstoken.

```python
import asyncio

from ms_agent import LLMAgent

# Configure MCP servers
mcp = {
  "mcpServers": {
    "fetch": {
      "type": "streamable_http",
      "url": "https://mcp.api-inference.modelscope.net/{your_mcp_uuid}/mcp"
    }
  }
}

async def main():
    # Use json to configure MCP
    llm_agent = LLMAgent(mcp_config=mcp)   # Run task
    await llm_agent.run('Introduce modelscope.cn')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Start
    asyncio.run(main())
```
----
💡 Tip: You can find available MCP server configurations at modelscope.cn/mcp.

For example: https://modelscope.cn/mcp/servers/@modelcontextprotocol/fetch.
Replace the url in `mcp["mcpServers"]["fetch"]` with your own MCP server endpoint.

<details><summary>Memory</summary>

We support memory by using [mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) in version v1.3.0! 🎉

Below is a simple example to get you started. For more comprehensive test cases, please refer to the [test_case](tests/memory/test_default_memory.py).

Before running the agent, ensure that you have set your ModelScope API key for LLM.

⚠️ Note: As of now, ModelScope API-Inference does not yet provide an embedding interface (coming soon). Therefore, we rely on external API providers for embeddings. By default, this implementation uses DashScope. Make sure to set your DASHSCOPE_API_KEY before running the examples.

```bash
pip install mem0ai
export MODELSCOPE_API_KEY={your_modelscope_api_key}
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY={your_dashscope_api_key}
```

You can obtain or generate your API keys at:

* [modelscope_api_key](https://modelscope.cn/my/myaccesstoken)
* [dashscope_api_key](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/?spm=5176.29619931.J__Z58Z6CX7MY__Ll8p1ZOR.1.4bf0521cWpNGPY&tab=api#/api/?type=model&url=2712195).

**Example Usage**

This example demonstrates how the agent remembers user preferences across sessions using persistent memory:

```python
import uuid
import asyncio
from omegaconf import OmegaConf
from ms_agent.agent.loader import AgentLoader


async def main():
    random_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    default_memory = OmegaConf.create({
        'memory': [{
            'path': f'output/{random_id}',
            'user_id': 'awesome_me'
        }]
    })
    agent1 = AgentLoader.build(config_dir_or_id='ms-agent/simple_agent', config=default_memory)
    agent1.config.callbacks.remove('input_callback')  # Disable interactive input for direct output

    await agent1.run('I am a vegetarian and I drink coffee every morning.')
    del agent1
    print('========== Data preparation completed, starting test ===========')
    agent2 = AgentLoader.build(config_dir_or_id='ms-agent/simple_agent', config=default_memory)
    agent2.config.callbacks.remove('input_callback')  # Disable interactive input for direct output

    res = await agent2.run('Please help me plan tomorrow’s three meals.')
    print(res)
    assert 'vegan' in res[-1].content.lower() and 'coffee' in res[-1].content.lower()

asyncio.run(main())
```

- **User query**

- - Chinese:

```text
在计算化学这个领域，我们通常使用Gaussian软件模拟各种情况下分子的结构和性质计算，比如在关键词中加入'field=x+100'代表了在x方向增加了电场。但是，当体系是经典的单原子催化剂时，它属于分子催化剂，在反应环境中分子的朝向是不确定的，那么理论模拟的x方向电场和实际电场是不一致的。

请问：通常情况下，理论计算是如何模拟外加电场存在的情况？
```

- - English:
```text
In the field of computational chemistry, we often use Gaussian software to simulate the structure and properties of molecules under various conditions. For instance, adding 'field=x+100' to the keywords signifies an electric field applied along the x-direction. However, when dealing with a classical single-atom catalyst, which falls under molecular catalysis, the orientation of the molecule in the reaction environment is uncertain. This means the x-directional electric field in the theoretical simulation might not align with the actual electric field.

So, how are external electric fields typically simulated in theoretical calculations?
```

> 1. Before running the examples below, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` environment variables to access the required model APIs. To run the full workflow, also configure the search engine variables EXA_API_KEY (https://exa.ai) or SERPAPI_API_KEY (https://serpapi.com).
> 2. FinResearch requires ms-agent version >= 1.5.0.

**Usage**:

Quickly launch the full FinResearch workflow for testing:

```bash
# Run at the ms-agent project root
PYTHONPATH=. python ms_agent/cli/cli.py run --config projects/fin_research --query 'Analyze CATL (300750.SZ) profitability over the past four quarters and compare it with key new-energy competitors (e.g., BYD, Gotion High-Tech, CALB); considering industry policies and lithium price volatility, forecast its performance for the next two quarters.' --trust_remote_code true
```

You can also run a minimal version without configuring a search engine by adjusting the [workflow configuration](projects/fin_research/workflow.yaml) as follows:

```yaml
type: DagWorkflow

orchestrator:
  next:
    - collector
  agent_config: orchestrator.yaml

collector:
  next:
    - analyst
  agent_config: collector.yaml

analyst:
  next:
    - aggregator
  agent_config: analyst.yaml

aggregator:
  agent_config: aggregator.yaml
```

### WebUI

MS-Agent provides a local agent workspace built with a React Router frontend and a FastAPI backend. Chat responses are streamed with Server-Sent Events (SSE).

#### Quick Start

The current launcher is intended for a source checkout. Install these tools first:

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Node.js 22.22.0 or newer
- pnpm 10.x (`corepack prepare pnpm@10.17.1 --activate`)

From the repository root, install MS-Agent in editable mode and start the WebUI:

```bash
pip install -e .
ms-agent ui
```

On the first run, the launcher creates the backend environment and installs the locked frontend dependencies. Later starts verify those local dependencies. The browser opens at <http://127.0.0.1:7860>.

Configure a model in **Settings → Models** before starting a real chat. Environment-variable bootstrap and manual development instructions are available in the [WebUI guide](webui/README.md).

**Windows tip:** If the console shows garbled text, use the UTF-8 PowerShell helper:

```powershell
.\webui\scripts\start-webui.ps1
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Use another public frontend port
ms-agent ui --port 8080

# Keep the browser closed
ms-agent ui --no-browser
```

See the [complete WebUI guide](webui/README.md) for prerequisites, configuration precedence, all launcher options, Windows notes, and troubleshooting. This minimal launcher intentionally does not provide a production SSR mode.

### Singularity Cinema

Singularity Cinema is an Agent-powered workflow for generating short videos, capable of producing high-quality complex short videos using either a single-sentence prompt or knowledge-based documents.

#### Core Features

- 🎬 **Supports Both Simple and Complex Requirements**: Can work with a single-sentence description or handle complex information files

- 🎹 **Sophisticated Tables and Formulas**: Can display and interpret formulas and charts within short videos that correspond to the script

- 🎮 **End-to-End**: From requirements to script to storyboard, from voiceover to charts to subtitles, and finally human feedback and video generation—the entire end-to-end process completed with a single command

- 🏁 **High Configurability**: Highly configurable with easy adjustments for voice, style, and materials through simple configuration

- 🚧 **Customizable**: Clear and simple workflow, suitable for secondary development

#### Quick Start

**Usage Example**:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx-xxx T2I_API_KEY=ms-xxx-xxx MANIM_TEST_API_KEY=xxx-xxx ms-agent run --config "projects/singularity_cinema" --query "Your custom topic" --load_cache true --trust_remote_code true
```
