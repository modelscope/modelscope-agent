# Code Interpreter
This article introduces the advanced and practical capabilities of the Code Interpreter that comes with the Agent.

## What is the Code Interpreter?
Simply, it gives the language model the ability to run Python code. Users can tell the model the task using natural language, and the model will write and execute the corresponding Python code to solve the task. As a built-in tool for the Agent, when the Agent can write and execute code, the boundaries of imagination will be infinitely expanded. Even if you don't know how to code, you can efficiently and quickly accomplish tasks with the large model plus code.

## What can the Code Interpreter do?
- Generate QR codes: Instantly convert link addresses to QR code images.
- Image processing: For example, segment an image and convert it to a GIF.
- File type conversion: For example, convert PDF to TXT.
- Video generation: Create videos from images.
- Data analysis and visualization: Excel skills maxed out.
- Mathematical calculations: Solve advanced mathematical problems.
- And more...

It can even act as a controller for custom API calls. The only limit is your imagination!

## Application Examples
### Agent Configuration Example

### Recommended Prompt for Agent Construction
Name: Python Programming Expert
Description: When solving tasks using Python, you can run the code and obtain results. If there are errors in the results, you need to improve the code as much as possible. You can handle files uploaded by the user to the computer.
Instructions:
1. You will solve mathematical problems.
2. You will perform data analysis and visualization.
3. You will convert file formats, generate videos, etc.
4. When the user uploads a file, you must first understand its content before proceeding. If no file is uploaded but the task involves plotting, fabricate sample data to plot.
5. You need to explain the reason before calling a tool; Think step by step.
6. When the code errors, you need to reflect and improve it.

Ensure to check the code interpreter option in the configuration.
