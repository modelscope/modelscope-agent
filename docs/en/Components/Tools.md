# Tools

## Tool List

MS-Agent supports many internal tools:

### split_task

Task splitting tool. LLM can use this tool to split a complex task into several subtasks, each with independent system and query fields. The yaml configuration of subtasks inherits from the parent task by default.

#### split_to_sub_task

Use this method to start multiple subtasks.

Parameters:

- tasks: ``List[Dict[str, str]]``, list length equals the number of subtasks, each subtask contains a Dict with keys system and query

### file_system

A basic local file CRUD tool. This tool reads the `output` field in the yaml configuration (defaults to the `output` folder in the current directory), and all CRUD operations are performed based on the directory specified by output as the root directory.

#### create_directory

Create a folder

Parameters:

- path: `str`, the directory to be created, based on the `output` field in the yaml configuration.

#### write_file

Write to a specific file.

Parameters:

- path: `str`, the specific file to write to, directory based on the `output` field in the yaml configuration.
- content: `str`: content to write.

#### read_file

Read file content

Parameters:

- path: `str`, the specific file to read, directory based on the `output` field in the yaml configuration.

#### list_files

List files in a directory

Parameters:

- path: `str`, relative directory based on the `output` in yaml configuration. If empty, lists all files in the root directory.

### code_executor

Code execution tool that can run Python code either in a sandboxed environment or directly in the local Python environment. The behavior is controlled by the `tools.code_executor.implementation` field.

- When omitted or set to `sandbox`:
  - Uses an [ms-enclave](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-enclave) based sandbox. The sandbox can be created locally with Docker or via a remote HTTP service.
  - Currently supports two sandbox types: `docker` and `docker_notebook`. The former is suitable for non-interactive/stateless execution; the latter maintains notebook-style state across calls.
  - The configured `output_dir` on the host is mounted into the sandbox at `/data` so code can read and write persistent artifacts there.

- When set to `python_env`:
  - Runs code in the local Python environment. The tool API is aligned with the sandbox version and supports both Jupyter-kernel based execution and plain Python interpreter execution.
  - With `include: [shell_executor]`, no Python/Notebook dependencies are initialized or installed. This is the default WebUI tool scope.
  - Before enabling `python_executor` or `notebook_executor`, prepare their dependencies in the Python environment that runs the SDK. WebUI does not preinstall PyArrow, scikit-learn or seaborn; install them with `pip install pyarrow scikit-learn seaborn`. Notebook execution also needs `pip install ipykernel jupyter-client`. The existing automatic setup attempts to install missing packages at initialization and requires working pip and network access; preinstall them for offline use.

#### notebook_executor

- **Sandbox mode**: Executes code inside a `docker_notebook` sandbox, preserving state (variables, imports, dataframes, etc.) across calls. Files under the mounted data directory are available at `/data/...`, and you can also run simple shell commands from code cells using the standard `!` prefix.
- **Local mode**: Executes code in a local Jupyter kernel, with environment isolation and state persistence across calls. In the notebook environment you can also use simple shell commands via the standard `!` syntax.

**Parameters**:

- **code**: `string` – Python code to execute.
- **description**: `string` – Short description of what the code is doing.
- **timeout**: `integer` – Optional execution timeout in seconds; if omitted, the tool-level default is used.

#### python_executor

- **Sandbox mode**: Executes Python code in a `docker`-type sandbox using the sandbox’s Python interpreter, typically used when you do not need full notebook-style interaction.
- **Local mode**: Executes code with the local Python interpreter in a stateless fashion; each call has its own execution context and does not share variables with previous calls.

**Parameters**:

- **code**: `string` – Python code to execute.
- **description**: `string` – Short description of what the code is doing.
- **timeout**: `integer` – Optional execution timeout in seconds; if omitted, the tool-level default is used.

#### shell_executor

- **Sandbox mode**: Dedicated to `docker`-type sandboxes and executes shell commands inside the sandbox using `bash`, supporting basic operations like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, etc., and access to files under `/data`.
- **Local mode**: Executes shell commands using the local `bash` interpreter with the working directory set to `output_dir`; this is convenient for development but generally not recommended for production.

**Parameters**:

- **command**: `string` – Shell command to execute.
- **timeout**: `integer` – Optional execution timeout in seconds; if omitted, the tool-level default is used.

#### file_operation

- **Sandbox mode**: Dedicated to `docker`-type sandboxes and performs basic file operations inside the sandbox (create, read, write, delete, list, exists). Paths are interpreted as sandbox-internal paths; in most cases you should work under `/data/...`.
- **Local mode**: Performs the same basic file operations on the local filesystem but always constrained under `output_dir` to prevent accessing arbitrary locations.

**Parameters**:

- **operation**: `string` – Type of file operation to perform; one of `'create'`, `'read'`, `'write'`, `'delete'`, `'list'`, `'exists'`.
- **file_path**: `string` – File or directory path (sandbox-internal in sandbox mode; relative to or under `output_dir` in local mode).
- **content**: `string` – Optional, content to write when `operation` is `'write'`.
- **encoding**: `string` – Optional file encoding, default `utf-8`.

#### reset_executor

- **Sandbox mode**: Recreates the sandbox (or restarts the notebook kernel) to clear all variables and session state when the environment becomes unstable.
- **Local mode**: Restarts the local Jupyter kernel used by `notebook_executor`, dropping all in-memory state.

#### get_executor_info

- **Sandbox mode**: Returns the current sandbox status and configuration summary (such as memory/CPU limits, available tools, etc.).
- **Local mode**: Returns basic information about the local execution environment (working directory, whether it is initialized, current execution count, uptime, etc.).

### MCP Tools

Supports passing external MCP tools, just write the configuration required by the mcp tool into the field, and make sure to configure `mcp: true`.

```yaml
  amap-maps:
    mcp: true
    type: sse
    url: https://mcp.api-inference.modelscope.net/xxx/sse
    exclude:
      - map_geo
```

## Custom Tools

### Passing mcp.json

This method can pass an mcp tool list. Has the same effect as configuring the tools field in yaml.

```shell
ms-agent run --config xxx/xxx --mcp_server_file ./mcp.json
```

### Configuring yaml file

Additional tools can be added in tools within yaml. Refer to [Configuration and Parameters](./Config.md) for details.

### Writing new tools

```python
from ms_agent.llm.utils import Tool
from ms_agent.tools.base import ToolBase


# Can be changed to other names
class CustomTool(ToolBase):
    """A file system operation tool

    TODO: This tool now is a simple implementation, sandbox or mcp TBD.
    """

    def __init__(self, config):
        super(CustomTool, self).__init__(config)
        self.exclude_func(getattr(config.tools, 'custom_tool', None))
        ...

    async def connect(self):
        ...

    async def cleanup(self):
        ...

    async def get_tools(self):
        tools = {
            'custom_tool': [
                Tool(
                    tool_name='foo',
                    server_name='custom_tool',
                    description='foo function',
                    parameters={
                        'type': 'object',
                        'properties': {
                            'path': {
                                'type': 'string',
                                'description': 'This is the only argument needed by foo, it\'s used to ...',
                            }
                        },
                        'required': ['foo_arg1'],
                        'additionalProperties': False
                    }),
                Tool(
                    tool_name='bar',
                    server_name='custom_tool',
                    description='bar function',
                    parameters={
                        'type': 'object',
                        'properties': {
                            'path': {
                                'type': 'string',
                                'description': 'This is the only argument needed by bar, it\'s used to ...',
                            },
                        },
                        'required': ['bar_arg1'],
                        'additionalProperties': False
                    }),
            ]
        }
        return tools

    async def foo(self, foo_arg1) -> str:
        ...

    async def bar(self, bar_arg1) -> str:
        ...
```

Save the file in a relative directory to `agent.yaml`, such as `tools/custom_tool.py`.

```text
agent.yaml
tools
  |--custom_tool.py
```

Then you can configure it in `agent.yaml` as follows:

```yaml

tools:
  tool1:
    mcp: true
    # Other configurations

  tool2:
    mcp: false
    # Other configurations

  # This is the registered new tool
  plugins:
    - tools/custom_tool
```

We have a [simple example](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/ms-agent/simple_tool_plugin) that you can modify based on this example.
