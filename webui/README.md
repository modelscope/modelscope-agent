# MS-Agent WebUI

Use MS-Agent in your browser to research, write code and work with project files.
Conversations, tool activity and generated results stay together so you can
follow a task and continue the conversation. [中文说明](README_ZH.md)

- **Organize work by project:** open a local folder, manage multiple sessions,
  and browse or edit project files.
- **Follow the agent's progress:** stream replies, reasoning, tool calls and
  generated files as the task runs.
- **Choose models and tools:** configure model providers, connect MCP tools and
  enable the skills each project needs.
- **Continue with context:** keep session history and manage project memory for
  later conversations.

## Quick start

### 1. Prepare the environment

| Tool | Requirement | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) | 3.12 or newer | SDK and API server |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) | 22.22.0 or newer | Frontend server |
| pnpm | 10.17.1 | Frontend dependencies |

After installing Node.js, install pnpm:

```bash
npm install --global pnpm@10.17.1
```

Check your environment with `python --version`, `node --version` and
`pnpm --version`. You can use an existing Python environment or create a virtual
environment if preferred.

### 2. Install and start

```bash
pip install -U "ms-agent[webui]"
ms-agent ui
```

The `[webui]` extra installs the Python dependencies for the interface. The first
start also downloads frontend runtime dependencies; later starts reuse them.
Pages and styles are already built in the package, so no frontend build is
needed for a pip installation.

The browser opens automatically, usually at **http://127.0.0.1:8000**. If the
port is occupied, the launcher selects another available port; use the URL
printed in the terminal. Press **Ctrl-C** to stop the service.

### 3. Start a conversation

1. Open **Settings → Models** and add a provider's API key, endpoint and model.
2. Create or open a project, choosing a workspace, skills and MCP tools as needed.
3. Create a session, choose a model and enter your task. Attach files or images
   when relevant.

## Startup options

```bash
# Choose the browser-facing port
ms-agent ui --port 8080

# Start without opening a browser
ms-agent ui --no-browser

# Listen on the machine's other network interfaces
ms-agent ui --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The application has no built-in login. Configure access control through a
reverse proxy or network settings when sharing it with other users.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--host HOST` | Bind address; defaults to `127.0.0.1` |
| `--port PORT` | Browser-facing port; otherwise choose a free port from 8000 |
| `--backend-port PORT` | Internal API port; usually does not need to be set |
| `--no-browser` | Do not open a browser |
| `--skip-install` | Skip dependency installation; still validate pages and CSS and rebuild stale source output |
| `--prepare-only` | Prepare dependencies and exit without starting services |
| `--startup-timeout SECONDS` | Startup timeout; defaults to 120 seconds |
| `--production` | Compatibility option; built frontend output is already the default |
| `--reload` | Currently unsupported; use the development commands below |

Explicit ports must be available and different for the frontend and API. If a
service exits unexpectedly, the launcher stops the other service and reports
an error.

## Configuration and data

Models, tools and memory can usually be configured in the interface. Environment
variables such as `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` are also supported;
`MS_AGENT_LLM_PROVIDER` and `MS_AGENT_LLM_MODEL` provide first-run defaults.

Project settings, sessions and managed skills are stored in `~/.ms_agent` by
default. Set `MS_AGENT_HOME` to use another directory. Project workspace files
remain at their original paths. Frontend dependency caches are separate from
application data; `MS_AGENT_WEBUI_CACHE` selects a different cache location.

Pip installations read process environment variables and saved SDK settings,
without discovering `.env` files in the current directory. Source installations
also read `.env` files from the repository root, `webui/` and `webui/backend/`,
in that order. Later files take precedence; process environment variables win
over all files. See the [configuration example](backend/.env.example).

Local vector memory needs the optional `fastembed` package and downloads an
embedding model on first use. Other model and search services use their own
settings; ordinary chat does not require a local embedding model.

## Run from source and develop

Source installations also require [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
0.5 or newer, which can be installed with `pip install uv`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modelscope/ms-agent.git
cd ms-agent
pip install -e .
ms-agent ui
```

The first start prepares the backend environment, installs frontend dependencies
and builds the application, including CSS. Later starts check whether source
changes require a new build.

For live development, open two terminals at the repository root:

```bash
# Terminal 1: API
cd webui/backend
uv sync --locked
uv run dev
```

```bash
# Terminal 2: frontend
cd webui/frontend
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**. The frontend development server connects to the
API on local port 8000 by default.

Run `uv run pytest` in `webui/backend/`, and `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm build` in
`webui/frontend/`. Use the full `pnpm build` command to generate matching CSS,
client files and server output.

Windows supports the same installation and startup commands. Source checkouts
also provide a PowerShell wrapper:

```powershell
.\webui\scripts\start-webui.ps1 --no-browser
```

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for development conventions and the
[build tools guide](../.dev_scripts/webui/README.md) for package preparation.

## Run with Docker

Docker does not require Python, Node.js or pnpm on the host. Replace `TAG` with
the published image tag you want to use:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 9000:8000 \
  -e MS_AGENT_HOME=/data -v ms-agent-data:/data \
  mshub-registry.cn-zhangjiakou.cr.aliyuncs.com/modelscope-repo/ms-agent:TAG
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:9000**. The `ms-agent-data` volume stores application data;
keep it when replacing the container. Mount project directories separately to
work on host files. To change the access port, change the left side of `9000:8000`.

`MS_AGENT_FRONTEND_HOSTED_MODE=1` hides local-path controls that are unsuitable
for remote users; access control still needs to be configured separately.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| `ms-agent`, `node` or `pnpm` is not found | Confirm installation and command availability in the current terminal; reopen the terminal after installation if needed |
| Python or Node version is unsupported | Check the requirements above and which interpreter the terminal uses |
| An explicit port is occupied | Choose another `--port`, or omit it for automatic selection |
| Pages or styles are missing | For source installs, run `pnpm build`; for pip installs, reinstall the package and follow the error message to prepare its cache again |
| Model connection or authentication fails | Check the provider's API key, endpoint, model name and network access |
| WebUI Python dependencies are missing | Run `pip install -U "ms-agent[webui]"` in the environment used to start the app |
