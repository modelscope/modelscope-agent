  // in both layouts the backend supports:
  //   standalone:  <repo>/backend        + <repo>/frontend
  //   embedded:    <repo>/webui/backend  + <repo>/webui/frontend
  // The backend additionally reads a shared layer one level further up
  // (`<repo>/.env`, see `backend/app/core/settings.py`) which this does NOT look
  // at -- put anything the frontend needs in `backend/.env` itself, under an
  // `MS_AGENT_FRONTEND_` prefix: `MS_AGENT_` keeps every key this project owns out
  // of the way of whatever else the shell has set, and `FRONTEND_` says which side
  // owns it. Third-party names stay verbatim by necessity (`OPENAI_API_KEY`,
  // `EXA_API_KEY`, ...): the backend republishes them to `os.environ` for the SDK
  // and for `mcp.json` `${VAR}` placeholders, which match them literally.
  //
  // Inheriting the backend's keys wholesale is safe on both counts that matter:
  //   - HOST / PORT do not collide. They land in `process.env` but nothing here
  //     consumes them: vite takes `server.port` from the config below, and the
  //     production entry (`server.js`, `pnpm start`) never runs vite, so it never
  //     reads this file at all. Verified with `PORT=8000 HOST=0.0.0.0 pnpm dev`,
  //     which still served 5173.
  //   - Provider credentials cannot reach the browser. Only `VITE_`-prefixed keys
  //     are exposed to client code, and vite refuses to let that prefix be
  //     widened to ''. They do enter the SSR process's `process.env`; that is
  //     acceptable while both processes run on the same host, and is the thing to
  //     revisit if the frontend is ever deployed apart from the backend.

  // would honour `MS_AGENT_FRONTEND_API_BASE_URL` for loaders (via `api.ts`, per
  // request) while silently ignoring it for this proxy -- sending SSR and the
