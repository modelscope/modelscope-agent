/**
 * "This picture did not reach the model."
 *
 * The single most useful thing this area was missing. Whether an attached image
 * actually entered the request was decided deep in the transport, written down
 * nowhere, and communicated to the user only by the model — in sentences it made
 * up. So "I can't see the image" could mean the switch was off, the endpoint had
 * refused, or the model was simply confabulating, and nothing on screen told
 * them apart. Each has a different remedy.
 *
 * Deliberately a corner dot rather than a banner: the normal case is silence,
 * and a conversation that switched models mid-way then explains its own history
 * — the turns the model could see have no dot, the ones it could not do.
 *
 * The dot means "the model has never received this picture", not "not on this
 * turn": once an image has been shown the record does not go back, so turning
 * the switch on clears the badge and the user can see that it worked.
 *
 * Subscribes to the live map itself rather than receiving it from the card, so a
 * delivery report mid-turn re-renders one dot instead of every attachment.
