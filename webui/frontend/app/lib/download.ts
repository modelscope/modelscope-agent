/**
 * Unified workspace download logic. Single source of truth for every "download"
 * affordance in the app:
 *
 * - single file  -> fetch the raw bytes, then save them from memory.
 * - directory     -> ask the server for a zip of that subtree.
 * - whole workspace -> ask the server for a zip of everything.
 *
 * `downloadWorkspacePath` auto-detects file vs directory from the file listing,
 * so callers can wire one handler to a per-row action regardless of kind.
 *
 * Zipping used to happen here, with fflate over bytes fetched file by file.
 * That meant one request per file with no concurrency limit, and a memory peak
 * of every file's bytes AND the finished archive at once -- enough to lose the
 * tab on a large workspace. The server now streams the zip as it compresses it,
 * so this is a single request and only the archive is held.
 *
 * Every one of them goes through `fetch`, deliberately. Pointing an `<a
 * download>` straight at the raw or archive URL would avoid copying through
 * memory, but that request leaves the document: the browser's download stack
 * makes it, so it does not inherit the frame's cookie partition. Deployed
 * inside an iframe with partitioned cookies -- a gateway putting its token
 * there -- such a download arrives with no credentials and gets rejected, while
 * every fetch-based download here succeeds against the same URL. The in-memory
 * copy buys credentials that work, plus a response we can inspect, which is
 * what `assertRawResponse` needs.
