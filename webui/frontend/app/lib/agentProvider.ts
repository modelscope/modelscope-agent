 *   result surfaces as a plan snapshot instead;
 * - a turn that ends before the call lands (error), where the last frame is not
 *   a step either.
 *
 * So every frame that proves the composing phase is over sweeps, not just the
 * step frame. Sweeping ALL placeholders (not the matching index) is deliberate:
 * the SDK writes a round's calls as one array, so any evidence the round moved
 * on retires the whole set. Beyond the stale animation this also keeps `isLast`
