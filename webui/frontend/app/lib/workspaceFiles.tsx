 * File step cards ("modified: x", "read: x") and user-bubble attachments show
 * a disabled "deleted" state when their file no longer exists. History replay
 * bakes an `exists` flag in, but that snapshot goes stale the moment the user
 * renames/deletes the file in the workspace rail. This provider keeps a fresh
 * path set: it re-fetches on every `msa:workspace-changed` event (fired by the
 * rail/project-page file operations and by mid-turn file writes), so cards
 * flip state immediately after a webui file operation.
 *
 * `null` = not loaded yet → consumers fall back to the server-baked flag.
