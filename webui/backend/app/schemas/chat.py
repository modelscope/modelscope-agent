               `meta.elapsed_ms` is that block's age at emit time (re-stamped

    - step:    a step card nested under a task (meta: kind, task_id?, status?)
    - session: emitted once at turn start when the session exists (meta:
               session_id, project_id) so the client can refresh its lists

               viewer can read it (see SessionRuntime.turn_user).
