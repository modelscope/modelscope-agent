"""Web-search adapter — global `tools.web_search` block in settings.json.

The SDK's WebSearchTool reads its engine and credentials straight out of that
block, so writing there is what makes a configured provider actually take effect
in chat. Nothing is mirrored into a sidecar: one source of truth, and the SDK is
already the reader.

Keys are stored PER ENGINE (`exa_api_key`, `serpapi_api_key`, …) because that is
what the SDK reads: its generic `api_key` field is only a backward-compat
fallback for exa, so a Tavily/SerpAPI key written there would look configured in
the UI while the tool silently found nothing. Per-engine storage also means
switching providers to look around never destroys a key, and the "configured"
tag describes the selected provider rather than "some provider".

The config block is the ONLY credential source this adapter knows about. The SDK
also falls back to `EXA_API_KEY` / `TAVILY_API_KEY` / … when its config field is
empty (websearch_tool.py builds `self._api_keys` that way, config first), and
this adapter deliberately ignores that: reporting two sources through one
"configured" tag made the state unreadable — you could not tell which key a
search would use, and a key the page never stored cannot be edited or removed
from the page either. So the settings page describes exactly what it manages.
