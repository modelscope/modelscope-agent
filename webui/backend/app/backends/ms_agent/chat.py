    Images and ordinary files diverge here, because only one of them the model
    can actually perceive:

    * **images** become ``attachments`` — image references the SDK expands into
      provider-native image blocks at the wire. Each gets an ``Image N: <file>``
      label, which is what lets a follow-up say "the second image" (and is
      Anthropic's own documented recommendation for multi-image turns);
    * **ordinary files** keep the previous behaviour exactly: a path listed in
      the prompt for the file tools to read.

    Both kinds still appear in the ``[Attached files]`` text block. That block is
    the durable session↔files mapping history replay reconstructs cards from, so
    dropping images out of it would make them vanish from reloaded history.

    **What this function must NOT say.** It runs when the request arrives, before
    anything has decided whether the images will actually be sent — the switch,
    the endpoint and the encoder are all downstream of here. It used to append

        (Image 1: a.png are shown to you directly above as images
         — no need to read those with file tools.)

    and that sentence was written verbatim into the session log, so it outlived
    every model switch and every toggle. A turn whose images never left the
    building still carried a permanent claim that they had, plus an instruction
    not to reach for the file tools either. Measured consequence: asked to "read
    it with a tool", the model refused, citing an ability it had been told it did
    not need. The claim about visibility now comes from the layer that knows —
    the transport, per request, per image — and nothing durable asserts it.

    wait on a previous turn's lock), and a client leaving inside that window
    used to take the turn with it: the cancel killed the generator before the
    enqueue, so the user's own message never reached the queue — nothing ran,
    nothing persisted, and no `done` ever arrived to clear the row's spinner.
    Everything here is either idempotent bookkeeping or the enqueue itself, so
    running it to completion for a client that has already gone is safe; the
    turn simply becomes an unwatched one, which the drain already handles.

    Skills are synced and slash invocations expanded with the lock already held:
    the driver is idle between turns, so the in-place catalog resync cannot race
    a running generation, and the expansion sees mid-session skill changes (this
    pre-sync ordering is why a newly added skill is invocable in the same
    session).

    Returns `(rt, enqueued, intro, sent)`. `enqueued` False means no turn was
    started and the lock is already back — `intro` then carries a non-turn reply
    for the caller to stream in its place. `sent` is the prompt AS ENQUEUED
