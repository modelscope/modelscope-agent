"""Workspace adapter — SDK Workspace(project.path) with a flat recursive listing.

The frontend renders a tree from a flat list of relative paths, so we walk the

state it holds (e.g. finer-grained permission files) — only its pure-machinery
subtrees (the ``snapshots`` git store, transient ``locks``) stay hidden, along
with the top-level ``sessions`` dir (session logs)."""
