"""Skill-update notices — tail-only skill sync for a session's model context.

The system prompt's skill list is a session-start snapshot and is never
rewritten (``skills.update_notice`` keeps the head byte-stable, so the
provider prefix cache survives skill changes). Instead, when the effective
skill surface changes — add/remove, enable/disable, description edit, or any
file change inside a skill's directory (SKILL.md, references/, scripts/, …) —
the next turn's user message is prefixed with a ``<system-reminder>`` notice
carrying the FULL current list. The static prompt section tells the model the
latest notice is authoritative.

The per-session sidecar ``skill_surface.json`` (beside plan.json) records what
the model was last told. It is only committed AFTER the turn is actually
enqueued — a failed/intro-only turn leaves it untouched so the notice re-fires
next time (safe over-notify, never silent-drop).
