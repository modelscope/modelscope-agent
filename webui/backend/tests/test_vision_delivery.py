"""Per-image delivery: reported live, persisted per turn, and forgettable.

The WebUI had no vision tests at all while it was writing a permanent claim
about every attached image into the session log. These cover the three things it
now owes the user:

* the turn text asserts nothing about visibility (that is the transport's to
  say, and only it knows);
* what actually happened is reported and survives a reload, so a reader can tell
  "the model never received it" from "the model received it and made something
  up";
* an observed refusal can be revoked without restarting the backend.
